  Resource : A manageable item that's available through Azure (e.g: VMs, storage accounts, web apps etc...)
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Resource group : A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.
</Callout>

### Azure resources groups 
- All resources must be in a resource group.
- A resource can only be a member of a single resource group.
- Many resource can be moved between resource groups.
- Resource groups can't be nested.
- <b> Before any resource can be provisioned, you need a resource group for it to be placed in</b>.

### Logical grouping
- By placing resource of similar usage, type, or location in a resource group, you can provide order and organization to resources you create in Azure.
- Logical grouping is the aspect that you're most interested in here, because there's a lot of disorder among our resources.

### Lifecycle
- If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within it are also deleted
- Organizing resources by life cycle can be useful in non-production environments, where you might try an experiment and then dispose it.
- Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources all at once.

### Authorization 
- Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC)

### Azure Resource Manager
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure.
</Callout>
- it provides a management layer that enabled you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account.
- you use management features like :
    - access control
    - locks
    - and tags
to secure and organize your resrouces after deployment

- When a user sends a request.
- Resource Manager receives the request.
- It authenticates and authorizes the request.
- Resource Manager sends the request to the Azure service.
- Azure service takes the requested actions.

### The benefits of using Resource Manager :
- Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
- A Resource Manager template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.
- Deploy, manage and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather that handling these resources individually.
- Redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle.
- Apply access control to all services because RBAC is natively integrated into the management platform.
- Clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources that share the same tag.
