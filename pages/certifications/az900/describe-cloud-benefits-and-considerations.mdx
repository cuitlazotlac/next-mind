### What are some cloud computing advantages ?

- <b>High availability</b> : Depending on the SLA that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.
- <b>Scalability</b> : Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally.
- <b>Vertically</b> : increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a VM.
- <b>Horizontally</b> : increase compute capacity, by adding instances of resources, adding VMs etc..
- <b>Elasticity</b> : You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need.
- <b>Agility</b> : Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.
- <b>Geo-distribution</b> : You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.
- <b>Disaster Recovery</b> : By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is sage in the event of disaster.

### Capital Expenses (CapEx) : 
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
up-front spending of money on physical infrastructure
</Callout>

- deducting that up-front expense over time.
- up-front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx) :
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
spending money on services or products now
</Callout>

- paying for a service or product as you use it.
- no up-front cost.
- billed now.
- this expense get deducted in the same year you spend it.

### Cloud computing is a consumption based model :
- operate on a consumption-based model.
- end users only pay for the resources that they use.

##### The main benefits :

- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.
- The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
