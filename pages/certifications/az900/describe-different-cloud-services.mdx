## Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

- closest to managing physical servers.
- cloud provider will keep the hardware up-to-date.
- but operating system maintenance and network configuration is up to you as the cloud tenant.

## Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

- cloud service model is a managed hosting environment.
- cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources.
- cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
- Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical hardware and software requirements.

## Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

- <b> Cloud provider</b> manages all aspects of the application environment, such
  as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.
- <b> Cloud tenant</b> only needs to provide their data to the application managed
  by the cloud provider.

## What is serverless computing ?

- Like PaaS, serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure.
- Cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.
- Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.
