## Data Types

-<b>Structured</b>: Data that can be represented using tables with very strict schema. Each row must follow defined schema. Some tables have defined relationships between them. Typically used in relational databases.
-<b>Semi-Structured</b>: Data that can be represented using tables without strict defined schema. Rows must always only have unique key identifier.
-<b>Unstructured</b>: Any files in any format. Likely binary files, application files, images, movies, etc.

## Storage Account 

- Group of services which includes : 
    - blob storage
    - queue storage
    - table storage, and
    - file storage
- Used to store
    - file
    - message, and
    - semi-structured data
- Highly scalable (up to petabyte of data)
- Highly durable (99.999999999% - 11 nines, up to 16 nines)
- Cheapest per GB storage

## Blob Storage
- BLOB - binary large object - file
- Designed for storage file of any kind 
- Three storage tiers : 
    - Hot - frequently accessed data
    - Cool - infrequently accessed data (lower availablitiy, high durability) 
    - Archive - rarely (if ever) accessed data

## Queue Storage
- Storage for small pieces of data (messages)
- Designed for scalable asynchronous processing

## Table Storage
- Storage for semi-conducted data (NoSQL)
    - No need for foreign joins, foreign keys, relationships or strict schema
    - Designed for fast access
- Many programming interfaces and SDKs

## File Storage
- Storage for files accessed via shared drive protocols
- Designed to extend on-premise file shares or implement lift-and-shift scenarios 

## Disk Storage
- Disk emulation in the cloud
- Persistant storage for Virtual Machines
- Different
    - sizes,
    - types (SSD, HDD)
    - performance tiers
- Disk can be unmanaged or managed
