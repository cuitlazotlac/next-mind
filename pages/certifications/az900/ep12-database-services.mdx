-<b>Structured</b>: Data that can be represented using tables with very strict schema. Each row must follow defined schema. Some tables have defined relationships between them. Typically used in relational databases.
-<b>Semi-Structured</b>: Data that can be represented using tables without strict defined schema. Rows must always only have unique key identifier.
-<b>Unstructured</b>: Any files in any format. Likely binary files, application files, images, movies, etc.
