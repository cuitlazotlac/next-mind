<b>To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription.</b>
<i>
  When you're completing Learn modules, most of the time a temporary
  subscription is created for you.
</i>

When you're working with your own applications and business needs, you need to create an Azure account, and a subscription will be created for you. After created Azure subscriptions, you can start creating Azure resources with each subscription :

#### Azure Free Account :

- Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months.
- A credit to spend for the first 30 days.
- Access to more than 40 products that are always free

#### Azure Free Student Account :

- Free access to certain Azure services for 12 months
- A credit to use in the first 12 months
- Free access to certain software develper tools

  What is Learn Sandbox ?
  
  Many exercises use a technology called the sandbox. 
  This create a temporary subscription allows you to create Azure resrouces for the duration of a Learn module.
  When you're completing a Learn module, you can use a personal subscription - sandbox is the preferred method to use though, because it allows you to create and test resources at no cost to you.
