- Lower your operating costs
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently
- Scale as your business needs change
- Rent compute power and store from someone else's datacenter

In our ever-changing digital world, two trends emerge: 
- Teams delivery new features to their users at record speeds
- Users expect an increasingly rich and immersive experience with their devices and with software

- Speech recognition and other cognitive services that help make your application stand out from the crowd
- Analytics services that deliver telemetry data from your software and devices
